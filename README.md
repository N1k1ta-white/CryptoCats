# CryptoCats

## Description
CryptoCats is a game for Telegram, made for fun and enjoyment by me. The main point of the game is collecting cryptocats (a hybrid of a cat and a popular cryptocurrency) and special coins (CryptoCoin and MemeCoin). Different tools like Spring Boot, Angular, JWT, and PostgreSQL were used in developing the project. The project is in the development phase, and many of my ideas haven't been implemented yet. The game's design was created by me in Figma. Interactions with Telegram are implemented using the official Telegram API for Telegram Web Applications, which is documented on their official site.
